# RecruitAI

### Aim
- Apply ML to segregate the resumes into different classes or groups. These classes or
groups must be utilised to enhance the Resume based Search Engine. 
- Create a recommender system which will prompt the recruiter with skills related to the
filters provided to enhance the search. 
- Create an automated Scraper to fetch profiles from public recruitment based platforms
- Association based mining to be used. The recruiter just needs to provide the post or
position in the organisation and the tool should provide the recommended candidates
